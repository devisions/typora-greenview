## Greenview - A theme for Typora

A green theme to be used in [Typora](https://typora.io) editor.

Highly influenced by my preferences of green and solarized dark like color schemes.

Most of the credits goes to [LostKeys](https://theme.typora.io/theme/Lostkeys/) and [Solarized](https://theme.typora.io/theme/Solarized/) themes authors. I just adjusted some colors, sizes and corner roundness.

The monopaced fonts that are configured (in this order) are: [Letter Gotic FS](https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/fontsite/letter-gothic-fs) Medium, and [Mononoki](https://github.com/madmalik/mononoki). The latter one is included in the theme as it is free. The first one is what I am currently using and is a paid one. Still, Mononoki is a very nice alternative.

Here is a sample of how it looks with _Letter Gothic FS Medium_ font:
